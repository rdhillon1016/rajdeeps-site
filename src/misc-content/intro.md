## About me

My name is Rajdeep Dhillon and I started this blog to combine two of my greatest passions: programming and writing. Perhaps others may find my posts beneficial, but if nothing else, blogging offers me a way to take some respite in this rapidly-accelerating field of software development and deeply reflect on my learning. I find there is beauty in taking a piece of knowledge that no doubt has been built on a foundation of years of learning and trying to put it in concise, easily comprehensible form.
